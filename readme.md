In addition there is a minmax_alphabeta.py file that has depth-limited alpha beta pruning logic.
The output from this file decides the move of the AI.

Run using the following commands:

Interactive mode :-
python maxconnect4.py interactive [input_file] [computer-next/human-next] [depth]

python maxconnect4.py interactive input1.txt computer-next 4


One move mode :-
python maxconnect4.py one-move [input_file] [output_file] [depth]

python maxconnect4.py one-move input1.txt output1.txt 1
python maxconnect4.py one-move input2.txt output1.txt 4
