My eval function is will decided a score using the logic below:
1 - Calculate the number of fours each player has got.
2 - Compare the number of fours of each player.
3 - Now if the max player has got more fours then return the number of fours it has got as a positive value
suggesting that this is the positive scenario for the AI and should try and go in this direction.
4 - If the max player has got lesser number of fours than then return the number of fours of the min player 
but as a negative value. This will tell the AI to definitely not take this scenario as it will lead to a loss.
5 - Incase the scores are equal then return 0 suggesting that this is a neutral scenario and the AI can choose 
this against a scenario got in step 4.
